    # AI Log Triage Lab

    Independent public portfolio project for **Python**, **automation**,
    **systems integration** and **solutions engineering**.

    This repository was created from scratch with a fictional domain and
    synthetic data. It does not contain corporate code, real data, private
    endpoints, credentials, logs or proprietary rules.

    ## Problem

    Operational logs need classification, summaries and explainable suggested actions without exposing real logs.

    ## Objective

    Build a safe AI-ready log triage lab using synthetic logs and structured output.

    ## Current Features

    - Synthetic JSONL logs.
- Deterministic triage baseline.
- Structured JSON output.
- Explanations and suggested actions.

    ## Architecture

    ```mermaid

        A["Synthetic input"] --> B["Python processing"]
        B --> C["Rules / validation"]
        C --> D["Generated local output"]
        D --> E["Future API / dashboard"]
    ```

    See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for details.

    ## Stack

    Current:

    `Python` `JSONL` `Structured output` `Synthetic logs`

    Planned evolution:

    - Ollama
- LLM APIs
- Human validation
- LangChain
- CrewAI
- Agents

    ## Run Locally

    ```powershell
    python examples/run_demo.py
    ```

    The demo uses only files under `data/sample/` and writes generated output
    to ignored local folders.

    ## Repository Workflow

    This project is intended to evolve through:

    - Issues for planned work.
    - Milestones for learning phases.
    - Small branches and pull requests.
    - Releases when a useful increment is ready.

    Draft issues are documented in [docs/github-issues.md](docs/github-issues.md).
